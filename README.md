## Generic RSS Feed Reader in Python

This Python code allows you to retrieve entries from any RSS feed and displays information about each entry.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3 (tested with 3.x)
- `feedparser` library: Install using `pip install feedparser`

**How to Use:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `rss_reader.py`).
2. Run the script from your terminal:
3. When prompted, enter the URL of the RSS feed you want to read.

**Note**


This code works with most RSS feeds, but the structure of information (titles, summaries, etc.) might differ slightly depending on the specific feed.
